Assignment Overview
This project assignment is worth 40% of your overall grade so please devote the necessary time to completing this assignment with your best effort. In this project you will create a multi-page website of your own design. The website can be about any topic or for any purpose you like - just make sure it’s family friendly. :)

The overall goal of this project is to give you a chance to develop a small website using HTML and CSS. Your website will demonstrate many of the concepts and functionalities that you have learned over these past several weeks, but you are not expected to create large amounts of content (text and imagery) for your site. With this in mind, you should feel free to:

use dummy text, which you can find at http://fillerama.io/ or https://www.lipsum.com.
use your own images or download free images at https://pixabay.com.
Specifications

******
Your website should:

Consist of at least 4 pages, including the Home page (index.html) and a Contact page.

The title and content headings of the remaining pages are completely up to you but they should support the overall topic and/or purpose of your site. Again, you don’t need to create large amounts “hand-crafted” text - use the lipsum generators listed above to fill out the pages so that they have some vertical depth. DONE

Include at least one external stylesheet (styles.css) that is referenced by each of your .html pages. This will create a consistent look-and-feel of your site. Class selectors, descendant selectors, pseudo-classes should be used where and when appropriate. DONE

Include at least 4 images and these should be stored in a directory named 'images’. DONE

Use a consistent menu of navigation buttons that appear on each page of your site. The placement of this menu should also be consistent between pages. (see Positioned Elements for Menus) DONE

Include at least 1 Flex container that contains at least 3 Flex Items. (see Flexbox) DONE

Be Responsive using media queries to support layouts for: Mobile (width of 0px to 400px), Tablet (width of 401px to 960px, and Desktop (961px and larger). (see Media Queries ) NOT DOING THIS

Include a Contact form (on your Contact page) that consists of:

at least 3 text input fields
1 email field
at least 1 of the following: radio buttons, select elements or checkboxes
(see HTML Forms)

Use Headings, Text, and Inline elements. DONE

Use Margins and Padding. DONE

How to complete this assignment
Before you begin coding any html or css, create a site map that identifies each page, its purpose, its title, and its links to other pages in your site and, possibly, to external pages. This map can be a simple hand-drawn block diagram that will help you think through what you want your site to contain.
Add your ‘images’ directory and upload your images there.
Create the html files (e.g., index.html, contact.html, etc.) and styles.css.
Make sure you meet each of the specifications listed above.
Be sure to ask me on Slack if you run into any obstacles or show-stoppers.
Start early so you have enough time to complete this by the due date!
